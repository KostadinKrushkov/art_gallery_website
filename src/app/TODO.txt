Possible TODO:
- Fix UI speed and css for mobile devices
- Improve the speed in the gallery page
- Add a loading spinner on the bottom of the gallery page when loading in more data

DONE:
- Add notification system on receiving response for put post and delete requests as well as general error handling
- Hold information regarding the logged in user so you can logout -> Stores information regarding type of user is logged in in brower storage, faking it wouldn't cause a problem since backend has additional checks
- Added loading spinner on auth, gallery, contact and blog pages when a client makes a request
- Fix the logout extra error message (both green and red box appear)
- Make the recaptchas work after a successfull request (they stay ticked on and can't retick it)
- Add are you sure popup for logout before sending the request
- Make sure that the lazy loading is working correctly for all modules
- Make and endpoint for the home screen items, so the admin can select them
- Figure out on edit why the toggle buttons aren't updated when data is passed
- Protect the website from CSRF -> turns out it's not neccesary. Tried implementing it but it seems that flask has some problem with CSRF + JWT tokens together
- Make clear documentation regarding how to run the application locally for development and how to release to prod in as few steps as possible
- Make the loading of the extra items in the blog and gallery to query data instead of just showing it
- Improve the querying in the gallery-page
